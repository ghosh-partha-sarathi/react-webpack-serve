# configure server start commands in package.json
Add below scripts block to package.json file IF NOT ALREADY ADDED
 "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --hot --open",
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
  }

# run below commands from two different terminals in parallel
  npm run start     (starts webpack dev server)
  npm run build     (starts webpack build using webpack config file)         

NOTE:
For security purposes, webpack-dev-server is NOT accessible externally. 
This is the main cause for error message "Invalid Host Header" while running through gitpod as dev server is run on a docker container.
To fix this issue in gitpod, we can set 'allowedHosts' property in devServer under webpack config.
We can whitelist services that we wish to be allowed to access the dev server using this option.
e.g.
    devServer: {
      allowedHosts: 'all'
    }
    OR we can also provide allowed host names explicitly, like-
    devServer = {
      allowedHosts: ['abc.com', 'xyz.in']
    }
When set to 'all' this option bypasses host checking. 
THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED as apps that do not check the host are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks.
However, 'allowedHosts' is not required when accessing application through browser in localhost. 

Alternatively we can use other servers like express instead of webpack.
