# configure server start commands in package.json
Add below scripts block to package.json file IF NOT ALREADY ADDED
 "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --hot --open",
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
  }

# run below commands from two different terminals in parallel
  npm run start     (starts webpack dev server)
  npm run build     (starts webpack build using webpack config file)         

NOTE:
This code runs perfectly fine in localhost but throws error message "Invalid Host Header" while running through gitpod.
As per my understanding this issue arises when webpack dev server is run on a docker container.
While using gitpod, this issue can be avoided by using express instead of webpack server.
